# Firewall Rule Configuration â€“ Task 4

This document shows the full process I followed while configuring and testing firewall rules using *UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall)* on Kali Linux, as part of *Task 4* in the Elevate Labs Cybersecurity Internship.

## Step 1: Listing Current Firewall Rules

Command used:
```bash
sudo ufw status verbose

 Step 2: Blocking Port 23 (Telnet)

Command used:

sudo ufw deny 23

Telnet is insecure and often targeted by attackers. Blocking port 23 helps reduce the attack surface.

 Step 3: Allowing SSH (Port 22)

Command used:

sudo ufw allow 22

This ensures I can still securely connect to the system using SSH.


 Step 4: Testing Port Block

I tested the block using a Telnet attempt from another machine:

telnet [192.168.87.136] 23

As expected, the connection failedâ€”proof that the firewall rule worked

 Step 5: Removing the Block Rule

To restore the firewall to its previous state:

sudo ufw delete deny 23

 Summary: How a Firewall Filters Traffic

A firewall filters traffic based on rules that define what is allowed or denied through specific ports and IPs. In this case, I blocked Telnet traffic to increase security, allowed SSH to maintain remote access, and confirmed everything was working as expected.
