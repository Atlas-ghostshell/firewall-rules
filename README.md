# Task 4 – Firewall Configuration and Traffic Filtering

This repository contains my work for *Task 4* of the Elevate Labs Cybersecurity Internship, focused on *firewall setup and management* using UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) on a Linux environment.

---

## Objective

> Configure and test firewall rules to allow or block network traffic using either UFW (Linux) or Windows Firewall.

---

## Tool Used

- *UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall)* – A simple command-line interface to manage firewall rules on Linux systems.

---

## Actions Performed

1. Enabled UFW and listed current rules  
2. Blocked *inbound traffic on port 23 (Telnet)*  
3. Allowed *SSH traffic on port 22*  
4. Tested blocked connection via Telnet  
5. Removed test block to restore firewall to original state  
6. Captured screenshots and documented all steps

---

## Files Included

- firewall_rules.md – Step-by-step documentation of all firewall commands, logic, and results  
- screenshots/ – Contains images showing rule creation, verification, and connection tests

---

## Learning Outcome

Through this task, I gained hands-on experience in managing firewall rules and understanding how traffic is filtered at the port level.  
I now better understand the *importance of securing unused ports* and maintaining a *minimal, controlled attack surface*.
